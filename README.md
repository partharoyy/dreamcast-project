Dreamcast Project for practical evaluation!
I have used legacy Redux instead of Redux-toolkit as it was not specifically mentioned, as recommended by Redux officially we should use Redux-toolkit!
I have added both the functionality Add, Edit, and Delete though it was optional!

Start project locally:
Clone the repo
npm install
npm run dev

or go to the deployed link => https://dreamcast-project.vercel.app/
