## Dreamcast Project for practical evaluation

Dreamcast Project for practical evaluation! I have used legacy Redux instead of Redux-toolkit as it was not specifically mentioned, as recommended by Redux officially we should use Redux-toolkit! I have added both the functionality Add, Edit, and Delete though it was optional!

### Start project locally

- Clone the Repo
- npm install or yarn
- npm run dev or yarn dev

### Live link

> Note - Going from Add mode to Edit mode is the normal flow, once in edit mode we need to reload the app to go back to Add mode
